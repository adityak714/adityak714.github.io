A collaborative project done in the course "Web Development - DIT342" at the University of Gothenburg. (view [repo](https://github.com/adityak714/mevn-app-handyman-finder/tree/master))

This application is aimed at clients who are in search of a capable handyman, for most common reparation and maintenance/installation jobs in homes. Upon account creation, the handymen can publish an advertisement that they are willing to work, and connect with clients, also on the platform. Upon so, clients can reserve timeslots/day-slots depending on agreement with the handyman. 

**My contributions:**
Worked on the authentication functionality of new and existing users (handymen and clients), creation of new users, and the interface for login/logged in users on the frontend side ([example commit](https://github.com/adityak714/mevn-app-handyman-finder/commit/cbab4e4886135f89eaba6489b4c62439121bc62d)). Additionally, created [tests](https://github.com/adityak714/mevn-app-handyman-finder/blob/master/server/tests/server.postman_collection.json) using Postman to assess the HTTP requests on the CRUD operations, and ensuring the right response and HTTP status codes are returned.

The full-stack application was made using the tech stack: **VueJS**, **Node JS**, and **MongoDB**. The website is responsive for different screen sizes, done using media queries.
