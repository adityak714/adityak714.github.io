I am a master's student (M.Sc.) in Data Science at Uppsala University, with a prior Bachelor's degree (B.Sc.) in Software Engineering & Management from the University of Gothenburg, in Sweden. The thesis topic explored in Software Engineering & Management was "Exploring Metrics for Safety and Reliability Assessment in an Automotive Emergency Braking Perception System: A Case Study". 

My interests are in the field of **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning**, with a deeper interest developing in the paradigm of Federated Machine Learning, allowing de-centralized model training from multiple clients in a privacy-enhanced method, where data does not need to be transferred, but occurs locally. I have previously worked in a diverse range of projects, primarily in **full-stack web development, data analysis, feature engineering, and ML-powered application development**. I have previously also worked with fine-tuning of Large Language Models in applications of telecommunication products and specs-information retrieval at Ericsson R&D. 

## Skills and Frameworks

I hold experience in software development in Python, Java, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. In a diverse range of team-based environments, I have applied software development practices, particularly Agile methodologies like Kanban and Scrum. 

Frameworks and tools that I have used: 

```
ML/DL          : TensorFlow, LangChain, PyTorch, scikit-learn
Web            : Django, VueJS, NodeJS, React
Data Analysis  : Numpy, Pandas, Apache Spark, Opensearch
Testing        : JUnit, PyTest, Postman
CI/CD          : GitLab CI, Docker
Cloud          : Google Cloud Platform (GKE)
Databases      : PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
```
