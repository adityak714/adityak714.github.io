Excerpt from the abstract: *Assessing the safety and reliability of automotive software systems is challenging, along with knowing which metrics to use to verify intended functional and non-functional requirements. Additionally, the lack of context definitions and ambiguities in metrics, are further issues found in the automotive supply chain. This study presents findings on exploring and comparing common safety and reliability metrics in literature and their applications in an automotive perception system case, which is under implementation.*
